Tugboat CAD rendering image, a large, sturdy vessel with a blue hull and a black, rubberized lower section, designed for heavy-duty towing and pushing operations. The bow features a prominent, rounded shape with two large, dark brown propellers, each with a distinct, metallic sheen, indicating their robust construction. The propellers are positioned symmetrically on either side of the vessel, with a central, slightly recessed area where the propeller shafts are likely housed. The tugboat's deck is equipped with various functional elements, including a small cabin with windows, likely for the crew, and several red and white safety rails along the upper deck. The cabin is positioned centrally, with two small, rectangular windows on either end. The deck also includes a few small, cylindrical structures, possibly radar or communication equipment
