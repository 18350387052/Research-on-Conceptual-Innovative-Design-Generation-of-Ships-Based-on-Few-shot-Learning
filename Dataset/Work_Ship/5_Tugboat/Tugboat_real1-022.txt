DANDE, a vibrant red vessel with a white superstructure, is captured in a photograph taken on a clear, sunny day. The tugboat is positioned in the middle of a calm, blue ocean, with a slight wake trailing behind it, indicating movement. The superstructure features a large, rectangular wheelhouse with windows, and a radar mast at the top. The wheelhouse is equipped with various navigational and communication equipment, including a radar antenna and a radio antenna. The deck is cluttered with various machinery and equipment, with the name "DANDE" prominently displayed in red letters on the side of the superstructure. The boat's hull is painted in a bright red color, with black accents and details, and the water around it is a deep blue, reflecting the clear sky above
