MINEWAI, a sturdy vessel with a predominantly blue hull and white superstructure, is seen navigating through calm waters. The tugboat features a sleek design with a black rubber bumper along the bow and stern, providing protection against collisions. The superstructure includes a bridge with windows, from which a crew member is visible, clad in a uniform, standing at the helm. The bridge is equipped with various navigational instruments and a flagpole, adorned with a flag featuring a red and yellow design. The flag is positioned at the top of the mast, fluttering in the breeze. The background showcases a serene coastal landscape with a hilly, forested island in the distance, under a cloudy sky. The water is a muted greenish-blue, reflecting the overcast sky. In the far background
